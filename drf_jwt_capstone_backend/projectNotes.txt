                  Workout Junction Table


    Each User will be able to view the workouts page. 
    The Workouts page will list the exercise names and possibly a few fields.

    I need to access related properties by calling the junction table and filtering by the workout_name ID.
    This filter should only return the exercises that are associated with that Id.

     Problem: As of now, I cannot access exercise properties or workout name through the junction table. 
                I can query the Workout_name table and print the name to the console within the GET() junction
                table function BUT I do not have an appropriate serializer to handle the modified request.
