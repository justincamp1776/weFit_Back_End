# weFit_Capstone_Project

The back end of this project is housed within the Django REST Framework. Most of the tables in the database are represented as individual apps accompanied by their respective List and Detail Views. Each app consumes requests such as Get, Post, Patch, and Delete. The workout app is currently being refactored to include Django's many-to-many field.
